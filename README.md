# BitManager - Server

Provides a service tying to bit-bin in order to create, update, and manage
remote scopes in a private setting. We use GraphQL to expose a simple API
consumed by the UI package [here](https://github.com/abeagley/bit-manager-ui)

Think bitsrc.io, but for your internal development.
